# Supabase

Supabase is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that provides developers with a set of tools to build, manage, and scale applications. It aims to simplify the process of setting up a backend by offering various services out of the box, similar to Firebase, but with an emphasis on open standards and flexibility.

### Key Features :

1. **PostgreSQL Database**: Provides a managed PostgreSQL database with SQL querying, relational data, and full-text search capabilities.
2. **Realtime Subscriptions**: Enables live updates by sending data changes (insert, update, delete) to connected clients in real time.
3. **Authentication**: Built-in authentication system supporting email/password, OAuth providers (Google, GitHub), and custom auth systems.
4. **Storage**: Offers scalable storage for managing media files like images and videos, ideal for handling user uploads.
5. **RESTful API**: Automatically generates RESTful APIs based on your database schema for easy interaction with the backend.
6. **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions that allow you to write custom backend logic without managing servers.
7. **Open-Source**: Fully open-source, enabling hosting on your own infrastructure and avoiding vendor lock-in.
8. **Frontend Integration**: Supports modern frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Next.js, with SDKs for seamless backend interaction.

### Use Cases for Supabase :

* Building applications with real-time features like chat apps or live collaboration tools.
* Projects that require user authentication and role-based access control.
* Storing and managing media files like images, videos, or documents.
* Rapidly building and scaling applications without setting up custom backend infrastructure.
